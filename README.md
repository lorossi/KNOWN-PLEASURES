# KNOWN PLEASURES

The 15 of June 1979, a then unknown band named "Joy Division" released their debut album.
No single was from that album was released, and the album did not chart (not even in the UK).

Only a few years later, after the main singer died, the album got the attention that it deserved.

I discovered this album only about last year, finally finding all these songs that I heard from time to time but I couldn't classify.
Needless to say, I fell in love with them.

One of the things that fascinated me the most, of course, was the album cover.
Originally it features an image of the radio wave from pulsar CP 1919, from *The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy*.

I wanted to try and give a personal spin to it, so here we go.
